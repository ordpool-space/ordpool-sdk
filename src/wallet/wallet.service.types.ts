 *   dialog. They emit the txid directly; `broadcast` is unused.
 * - **Leather**: signs the PSBT and returns it. The signer finalizes
 *   via scure and then delegates broadcasting back to the caller
 *   via the `broadcast` callback — the caller owns the mempool API
 *   (electrs `POST /tx` via the configured HttpClient).
 * - **PSBT-export (Sparrow / Electrum / Coldcard / Ledger / Trezor /
 *   …)**: signing happens out-of-band in the user's own wallet
 *   software. The signer hands the unsigned PSBT to
 *   `promptForSignedPsbt`, which is responsible for showing a
 *   download / paste UI and emitting the signed PSBT back when the
 *   user is done. Then finalise via scure and call `broadcast`.
 *
 * Passing the bridges as parameters keeps signers free of HTTP and
 * DOM dependencies while still letting the contract be "PSBT in,
 * txid out" for every wallet uniformly.
